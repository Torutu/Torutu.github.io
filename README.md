# Welcome to My GitHub Page! 👋

Hi there! I'm a passionate programmer and a student at **42 Hive Helsinki**, diving deep into the world of software development. I'm currently learning and working with **C++**, **C**, and **Godot** to build exciting projects and expand my skills.

## About Me 🧑‍💻

- **Name**: Waleed Alnaimi
- **Location**: Helsinki, Finland
- **Interests**: Programming, Game Development, Open Source, Algorithms
- **Current Focus**: Mastering C++ and C, exploring Godot for game development, and tackling challenges at 42 Hive.

## Skills 🛠️

- **Languages**: C, C++, Python (basic), GDScript (Godot)
- **Tools**: Git, Makefile, VSCode, Godot Engine
- **Concepts**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Memory Management, Object-Oriented Programming

## Projects 🚀

Here are some of the projects I'm working on or have completed:

### Godot Minigames 🎮

I’ve created several minigames in Godot, each focusing on a unique challenge:

1. **Clicker Game**: A simple clicker game with animations and sound effects.  
2. **Coin Collecting Game**: A 2D/3D hybrid game with a coin randomizer, collision detection, and a scoring system.  
3. **Dialog Game**: A custom dialog system for interactive storytelling.  
4. **Simon Says**: A 3D logic-based game with button animations and lighting effects.

These projects helped me explore game mechanics, logic implementation, and Godot’s 2D/3D tools.


### C++ Projects 💻

1. **Asciinator**  
   - Converts images into ASCII art.  
   - **What I Learned**: Image processing, pixel manipulation, and file I/O.

2. **Dithernator**  
   - Applies a dithering effect to images using a modified Floyd-Steinberg algorithm.  
   - **What I Learned**: Advanced pixel manipulation, algorithm optimization, and image filtering.

3. **Daily_Quests**  
   - A habit-tracking program that asks 8 important daily questions and logs them into a CSV file.  
   - **What I Learned**: File handling, CSV manipulation, and user input management.
   

## Learning Goals 🎯

- Master advanced C++ concepts like templates, smart pointers, and multithreading.
- Build a complete game using Godot Engine.
- Add Impactful mods to games like Skyrim, Sims4, Total War franchise and Rimworld.
- Complete the 42 Hive curriculum and become a proficient software engineer.
